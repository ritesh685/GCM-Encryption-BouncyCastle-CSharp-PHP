C# using the GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) algorithm with Bouncy Castle, and decryption in PHP using OpenSSL. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

Encryption in C# (using Bouncy Castle):

The Main method initializes the plaintext, generates a 256-bit secret key (key), and generates a 96-bit nonce (nonce).
The Encrypt method is called, passing the plaintext, key, and nonce.
In the Encrypt method, a GCM block cipher with AES as the underlying encryption algorithm is created using the GcmBlockCipher class from Bouncy Castle.
AeadParameters are set up with the key and nonce, and the cipher is initialized for encryption (cipher.Init(true, parameters)).
A byte array ciphertext is created to hold the encrypted data, and the encryption process is performed using cipher.ProcessBytes and cipher.DoFinal.
The authentication tag (tag) is retrieved using cipher.GetMac().
The ciphertext is returned as the result of the Encrypt method.
Decryption in PHP (using OpenSSL):

In PHP, the provided ciphertext with the appended tag in hexadecimal ($ciphertextWithTagHex), key in hexadecimal ($keyHex), and nonce in hexadecimal ($nonceHex) are initialized.
The ciphertext and tag are extracted from the provided ciphertext with substr.
The openssl_decrypt function is used to decrypt the ciphertext. It takes the ciphertext, encryption algorithm (aes-256-gcm), key, OpenSSL_RAW_DATA as the option for returning raw binary data, nonce, and the authentication tag.
If the decryption is successful ($decrypted is not false), the decrypted plaintext is displayed. Otherwise, an error message is shown.
Please note that the code assumes the availability of the necessary libraries (BouncyCastle.Crypto.dll for C# and the OpenSSL extension for PHP) and the proper setup of the PHP environment for OpenSSL functions.

Remember to handle key and nonce management securely, ensuring their confidentiality and integrity. Additionally, ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed and configured correctly in your development environment for both C# and PHP
